### DNA Words
As well as the frequency of each of the individual nucleotides (“A”, “G”, “T”, “C”) in a DNA sequence, it is also interesting to know the frequency of longer DNA “words”. The individual nucleotides are DNA words that are 1 nucleotide long, but we may also want to find out the frequency of DNA words that are 2 nucleotides long (ie. “AA”, “AG”, “AC”, “AT”, “CA”, “CG”, “CC”, “CT”, “GA”, “GG”, “GC”, “GT”, “TA”, “TG”, “TC”, and “TT”), 3 nucleotides long (eg. “AAA”, “AAT”, “ACG”, etc.), 4 nucleotides long, etc.
